# Final-Project-X--COMP593

3/19/2022 3:54 AM - Work Update
Currently working on recieveing http connection and response
successful request to the nasa server though http connection with response 200

due to the fact that i've started working on lab 6 and wasn't working with functions before lab 6 we have decided to switch over to the requests module which we are using instead of using the stupid HTTP module that i hate a lot. Thank you requests is so much better.
Functions EZ praise the python gods.
