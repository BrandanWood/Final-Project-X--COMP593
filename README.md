# Final-Project-X--COMP593

3/19/2022 - Currently working on recieveing http connection and response
successful request to the nasa server though http connection with response 200

due to the fact that i've started working on lab 6 and wasn't working with functions before lab 6 we have decided to switch over to the requests module which we are using instead of using the stupid HTTP module that i hate. Thank you requests is so much better.

4/7/2022 - Didn't realize you needed to use the template provided. basically starting from scratch now. datetime module is being imported but for some reason doesn't know what datetime.strptime is? i'll figure this out soon i hope. moving on to getting that image url first.

4/17/2022 - strictly using the apod_desktop.py as a reference while i build it myself and taking only the parts of the code that i need, kind helps me become more familier with what the process of actually building something like this from the ground up us like

Reviewed the lab video to find out what things i needed to import, if i need to import anything else i guess i'll figure it out along the way. get_apod_info nabbing the apod date from before and then it now return the apod_dict. Not sure if i'll need to return the whole dictionary of just parts of this with this function but that's for later i guess if it doesn't work the way i need it to.
